# PreToolUse guard on the Bash tool: catches shell-output bypasses of
# AGENTS.md's Conventions ("never read a whole file when only part is
# needed" / "filter shell output before it lands in context") and denies
# them instead of letting the dump land silently. Four shapes:
#   - unpiped `cat` of a markdown file, or of any file over LARGE_LINES lines
#   - unpiped `git show`/`git diff` with no --stat and no pathspec
#   - unpiped `find` with -type f/d and no -name/-path/-iname/-regex
#   - raw `gh issue view` (Gate 1b: always issue-view.sh)
#   - raw `gh pr view` (always pr-view.sh — same GraphQL projectCards bug)
#   - `git commit` while the checkout is on `main` (branch off main, never
#     commit to it — the safety net for an agent that missed the worktree)
#   - `git push` whose destination is `main`, explicit or (on bare `git
#     push`) implied by the current branch already being `main`
#
# Reads a PreToolUse hook payload on stdin, writes a deny-decision JSON
# object on stdout when it blocks, nothing when it doesn't.
