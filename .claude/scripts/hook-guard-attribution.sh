# PreToolUse guard on the Bash tool: denies a git commit / gh pr create /
# gh pr edit / gh pr comment / gh issue create / gh issue comment that
# carries a tool-attribution trailer (Co-Authored-By, "Generated with",
# ...). CONTRIBUTING.md and AGENTS.workflow.md both forbid these in
# commits, PR bodies, issues, and comments — this stops the command before
# it runs instead of relying on the agent having read that prose first.
#
# Deliberately does NOT early-exit on a heredoc (`<<`) the way
# hook-guard-shell.sh does: a heredoc is exactly how commit/PR bodies are
# usually passed, so the trailer text lives inside it. A body passed via
# --body-file / --file / -F is scanned too: the file is read if it exists.
#
# Reads a PreToolUse hook payload on stdin, writes a deny-decision JSON
# object on stdout when it blocks, nothing when it doesn't.
