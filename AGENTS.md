# AGENTS.md

Router for AI coding agents. Read first.

**Concise, compact, facts only.**

## Repo

`rust-modbus` — async Modbus client and server over RTU and TCP. Single library crate, no binary. Product: [`PRD.md`](./PRD.md). Structure: [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

<!-- CORE:BEGIN spec-driven -->
## Spec-driven

- `docs/specs/` authoritative. Code conforms to spec, never reverse.
- Read area's `requirements.md` + `edge-cases.md` before editing that area. `edge-cases.md` = deliberate ugliness; check before "fixing."
- Behavior change with no spec change = incomplete.
- `main` never holds unfinished spec: a requirement on `main` describes code that exists and is tested. A branch may hold a spec commit ahead of its code; squash merge keeps that off `main`.
- Pre-existing spec/code disagreement outside your task: stop, raise separately. Folding it in widens approved work, skips its own review.
- Specs carry no `file:line`. Locate code with search tools.
- Requirement IDs stable, append-only. Cite in commits and PRs.
- One requirement, one physical line, never wrapped — find any by `grep -rn <ID or keyword> docs/specs/`, or with the exact file:line to edit: `sh .claude/scripts/extract-id.sh <ID> [<ID> ...]` (batch every ID needed into one call). Read one section of a large spec file instead of the whole thing: `sh .claude/scripts/extract-section.sh '## <heading>' path/to/file.md`.
<!-- CORE:END spec-driven -->

<!-- CORE:BEGIN tdd -->
## TDD — fixed order, every stage

1. Write the test. Doc comment cites requirement ID (`/// FR-R-012 — …`).
2. Run it, watch it fail for the right reason, report the failure. Wrong assertion / test-side compile error / premature pass proves nothing.
3. Minimum implementation that passes.
4. Refactor green.

- Implementation without a preceding failing test: not done. Test written after the fact to fit code: not done.
- Expected values from the authoritative source (Modbus standard) — never a debug print of your own implementation. Coverage floor 80% of lines, CI-gated on every push and PR — never inflate it with tests that execute code without asserting.
<!-- CORE:END tdd -->

## Workflow

Triggers on **behavior change, any size**: new public function, changed default, new error variant, any observable semantics. Not a behavior change: refactor, rename, perf-with-identical-semantics, tests, docs — no gates, just do it. Size sets stage count, never gate existence.

- Replaces any generic workflow skill (`/workflow`) — don't run one. `docs/specs/` is already the PRD and design record.
- Branch off `main`, never commit to `main`. `<type>/<slug>`, type ∈ {`feat`, `fix`, `docs`}.
- **Gate 1 = orchestrator's own conversation with the user, not an agent's.** Abstract: existing spec + current goal, nothing about current code. No worktree/branch until gate 2 approved.
- Gate 2 onward delegates to agents. **All agents Sonnet or better** — weaker models stop mid-plan, commit stubs as "green," report hanging tests as verified.
- **Issue and PR belong to the orchestrator alone.** Neither planning nor implementing agent is ever told an issue number exists; orchestrator updates the issue itself if planning surfaces a spec change.
- **One git worktree per issue per agent**, `.claude/worktrees/<slug>` — inside project dir (agent-reachable), gitignored. Two agents in one checkout interleave commits — a branch is not a working tree. Created only once gate 2 is approved (first thing to touch disk); removed after merge.
- Plan is a contract. Wrong plan → implementer stops and reports, never improvises a different design.
- **Sequential gate-2 choice → planning agent continues as implementer**, same running agent resumed (not respawned) — exploration behind the plan never re-derived. Parallel → fresh implementer per stage (concurrent, separate worktrees, can't share a running context).
- **An agent's report of its own verification is not verification.** Re-run the tools.
- **Every state change moves a task-board card.** State living only in conversation is lost when the session is.
- **An area whose `requirements.md`/`edge-cases.md` has grown large enough that reading it costs real context: propose splitting it**, at gate 1, before drafting. Split along a real sub-capability boundary already present in the area (e.g. `client` → `client-transport` + `client-retry`), never an arbitrary line-count cut — a split that isn't along a genuine seam just adds a second file covering the same thing. New prefix for the new sub-area; **moved requirements keep their original ID unchanged** (old prefix and number, just relocated to the new file) — IDs are cited in tests, re-IDing them breaks every citation for no reason. Only requirements added after the split take the new prefix. Routing table updated, same as adding any area. User approves; this doesn't fire silently.

Verify before every approval request:
- **Plan** — quoted requirement text matches file, appended IDs genuinely unused, nothing contradicts an existing requirement, proposes what was asked.
- **Implementation** — re-run full build/test/lint/coverage gauntlet yourself in the agent's worktree, read the code described, check ID citations sit beside test declarations, mutation-check any after-the-fact-looking test, diff spec against approved. Keep only the relevant excerpt of any command output in context — failure text, summary line — never a full verbose log.

### Task board

State on disk so an interrupted session resumes, not restarts. Directory a card sits in **is** its state:

```
.claude/tasks/
  open/  inprogress/  inreview/  done/   cards move between these
  artifacts/<slug>/
    spec-diff.md   gate 1 approved normative text
    plan.md        gate 2 stages, steps, dependency tree
    review.md      review findings, keyed by stage id
```

Directories tracked; cards gitignored local state. Cards live in **main checkout only** — a worktree agent gets its own card's absolute path, writes only that file. Never a per-worktree board copy.

| Card | File | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| parent | `<slug>.md` | orchestrator — one per run |
| stage | `<slug>.s<n>.md` | the implementer working that stage |
| wave gate | `<slug>.w<n>.md` | orchestrator — one per parallel wave |

Cards are agent-only artifacts, never written for human reading: YAML frontmatter + append-only log, terse field=value tokens, no prose. Agents **append**, never rewrite a log line — crash mid-write costs one truncated line, not the file.

```
---
id: <slug>.s3
parent: <slug>
blocked-by: [<slug>.s2]
files: [src/x.rs, tests/x.rs]
branch: <type>/<slug>-3
worktree: .claude/worktrees/<slug>-3
---
2026-01-02T14:02 spawn agent=impl
2026-01-02T14:05 test-red <ID> rejects_short_input
2026-01-02T14:11 green commit=abc123f
2026-01-02T14:12 gauntlet=pass
```

Parent frontmatter: `issue`, `branch`, `mode: sequential|parallel(N)`, `gate1`/`gate2` approval dates, current `wave`, `artifacts`. Never the goal or normative text — issue holds the goal, `artifacts/` holds the spec.

| Card | `open` | `inprogress` | `inreview` | `done` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| stage | created from plan | agent took it | agent claims green | merged + orchestrator-verified |
| wave gate | not started | stages running | all done; reviewing wave diff | clean — next wave unblocks |
| parent | gate 1 pending | implementing | gate 3/4 | PR squash-merged |

Rules:
- **No agent writes its own `done`.** Implementer stops at `inreview`. Orchestrator merges, re-runs gauntlet, only then moves to `done` — same self-report rule as everywhere else.
- **Runnable** = every `blocked-by` id in `done/`. Stage `done` = merged into the feature branch ("the code I depend on is on the branch I branch from").
- No `blocked/` directory — blocking derives from `blocked-by`, stated once.
- Card is evidence of intent, never fact. Git is fact. See *Resume*.
- `done/` is a resting spot for a run in progress, not a permanent record — every card for the run is deleted once the PR is merged. See *Merge*.

### Gate 1 — spec diff. Orchestrator runs this itself. Stop for approval.

Not delegated — direct interactive conversation, orchestrator + user, about existing spec + current goal.

- **No implementation detail.** No code reading, no code-vs-spec check here — the dialog outcome decides that. Spec-already-correct → dialog ends with no diff: state the violated requirement, continue to gate 2.
- Surface every silent decision (scope, defaults, naming, in/out) one at a time, with a recommendation. Reading area `requirements.md`/`edge-cases.md` is spec-reading, expected.
- Propose the normative text itself: "shall" statements + appended IDs, plus `edge-cases.md` entries. Ready to land, not prose about intent.
- Observable design is spec: public signatures, error enum, feature gating, config keys.
- **Board:** create `open/<slug>.md` + `artifacts/<slug>/` before the dialog — no worktree yet, nothing to put in one. On approval: write `artifacts/<slug>/spec-diff.md`, record `gate1` on parent card.
- **`spec-diff.md` shape:** one `## <ID>` heading per new or changed requirement (its full normative text under it, old → new if changed), then one `## Other spec changes` heading for `edge-cases.md`/`api-contract.md`/`data-contract.md` entries that carry no single ID. Same reason `plan.md` is headed per stage: `.claude/scripts/extract-section.sh '## <ID>' artifacts/<slug>/spec-diff.md` lets a wave-scoped reviewer pull only the IDs its stages touch, never the whole file.

### Gate 1b — tracking issue. Orchestrator runs this itself. Stop for approval.

- Search `gh issue list` + closed issues for same goal; read any candidate with `sh .claude/scripts/issue-view.sh <number>`, never raw `gh issue view`. Reuse + reference its number; never open a second. Else draft, get approval, `gh issue create`.
- Title: plain language a maintainer can scan. Not a slug, ID, or commit subject.
- Self-contained (spec not pushed yet): quote full normative text beside each new ID, each changed requirement as old → new, plus `api-contract.md`/`edge-cases.md` entries. ID with no text is useless.
- Goal + normative changes only. No implementation detail (structure/files/functions/approach) — belongs to gate 2 and PR.
- `##` sections, not prose: `## Background`/`## Why`, `## Scope`, `## Goal`, more as warranted. Compact enumerations, grouped ID ranges. Same shape for PR bodies.

Neither planning nor implementing agent is ever told this issue exists. Orchestrator is sole owner, including later updates from gate 2 findings. **Never edit the issue body after filing** — always `gh issue comment` to append the delta. An edited body destroys the history of what was originally filed vs. refined later; a comment preserves that trail and keeps the issue trackable.

### Gate 2 — implementation plan. Stop for approval.

Spawn the planning agent with a brief: approved spec text, affected area(s), anything user volunteered at gate 1. Nothing else — gate 1 did no code research; agent explores the repo itself. Never mention the issue.

Returns `plan.md` (shape: `spec-planner.md`'s `## Output`) — verification methods for this project: unit tests alone / loopback TCP integration / virtual serial pair / interop against an external master or slave, plus expected coverage impact. Any later reader — implementer, reviewer, resumed session — pulls exactly one section with `sh .claude/scripts/extract-section.sh '## Stage s<n>: <name>' artifacts/<slug>/plan.md`, never the whole file.

Existing-code references are inline at the step, complete enough that the implementer never re-opens the codebase to understand one — not just `(file:line)`, the exact signature/pattern it must match. A parallel implementer is a fresh spawn with zero exploration of its own; an under-specified reference is an incomplete step, caught here at approval, not after a stage stalls on it.

May pause with one concise plan-scoped question — answer, it continues. If it reports a **spec gap** instead (approved text doesn't cover something the plan needs): stays running, paused; orchestrator reopens gate 1 with the user, scoped to the gap, then resumes the *same* agent (never respawns) with settled text, updates issue if it changed.

`## Shared`'s **Dependency tree**: per stage, dependencies + files touched. No path between + disjoint files → parallel-capable; else ordered. Read as waves — a stage is runnable once its dependencies merge. Overlapping files = a dependency, not a race to resolve later. Fully-sequential plan states so explicitly — normal outcome, not a decomposition failure.

Approval also settles **how it's implemented** — unanswered = not approved:
- **Sequential** — same planning agent continues as implementer, resumed not respawned, keeps its exploration context.
- **Parallel** — user gives max concurrent agents; fresh implementer per stage. Waves capped at that number.

Default sequential on no preference. Never infer concurrency from plan shape — five parallel-capable stages doesn't authorize five agents.

**On approval, in order:**
1. Create the worktree — first thing to touch disk in the run: `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<slug> -b <type>/<slug> main`.
2. Write `artifacts/<slug>/plan.md`, record `gate2`+`mode` on parent card, move parent → `inprogress/`.
3. Create `open/<slug>.s<n>.md` per stage, `files`/`blocked-by` copied from the tree. Parallel: also `open/<slug>.w<n>.md` per wave. Sequential: one wave-gate card for the whole run. Stage ids match plan ids.
4. Land approved spec text in the new worktree — normative only, nothing unfinished. First stage, first commit.

### Implement, stage by stage

Sequential: same planning agent, resumed with worktree path + stage cards — no re-reading `AGENTS.md`, no re-exploring. It reads the implementer rules itself, follows them per stage in plan order. Moves stage card `open`→`inprogress` on start, →`inreview` on green+committed. Orchestrator verifies, moves to `done` — nothing to merge, so `done` = committed+verified.

Parallel: one worktree+branch per agent, branched off the feature branch at wave start — `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<slug>-<n> -b <type>/<slug>-<n> <type>/<slug>` — **fresh** implementer, not a continuation (concurrent agents can't share a running context). Plan's inline refs must be self-sufficient because of this — these agents hold none of the planner's exploration and must never re-derive it by exploring the codebase themselves; an incomplete reference is a stop-and-report against the plan, not something to go dig up. Never two agents, one worktree. Each wave:

1. Runnable stage cards (`blocked-by` all in `done/`) up to approved count. Wave-gate card → `inprogress/`.
2. One implementer per stage: its worktree path, its own card's absolute path, and its `## Stage s<n>` section pulled with `sh .claude/scripts/extract-section.sh` — never the whole `plan.md`.
3. Wait for the whole wave; each card lands in `inreview/`.
4. Per card: merge into feature branch, re-run gauntlet on merged result, card → `done/`, remove worktree.
5. All `done` → wave gate → `inreview/`: independent reviewer reads the wave's accumulated diff, given the wave's stage ids as its scope (so it pulls only those `plan.md` sections, not the whole file). Clean → wave gate `done/`, next wave unblocks, no approval prompt. Finding → stop, report, implicated stage cards → `inprogress/` with finding appended.

Clean wave gate is not an approval stop — gate 2 already approved these stages. A finding, red gauntlet, or merge conflict always is.

Merge conflict between two stages in a wave = dependency tree was wrong — report, fix the tree, never hand-resolve and continue. Mid-wave stop stops that wave only: finished branches still merge, the rest re-plans.

Gates unchanged under parallelism — verification, review, spec reconcile all happen once, on the merged feature branch, never per agent.

- TDD order above. Stage = green checkpoint: builds, tests pass, lint clean, coverage ≥ 80%. Commit every green stage — makes the plan resumable.
- Stage messages cheap, squashed later. Squash message carries requirement IDs + why. Spec = first stage, first commit.
- **Never add `Co-Authored-By`, "Generated with," or any tool attribution trailer** to a commit, PR body, issue, or comment — no information, pure `git log` noise, forever. Applies to every agent, every gate, including the squash message and the gate 4 PR body.
- Every new/changed requirement ships ≥1 ID-citing test.
- Every existing test pinning observable behavior cites its requirement. Pure internal/helper-detail tests may stay untagged. Behavior no requirement states = requirement missing — add it (gate 1), never attach a loose ID.
- Citation directly beside the test declaration, above the function body. ≤1 ID per test.
- Not done until the Verification method has run and its outcome is reported. Waiving it requires asking.

### Reconcile the spec

Behavior differing from gate 1 approval is normative, **reopens gate 1**: show the diff, state what forced it, get approval before committing. Wrong cross-reference / clumsy wording = editorial, no approval needed. Always report the final spec diff.

### Gate 3 — review. Stop for approval.

Before proposing a PR: independent review in a **separate agent** that didn't write the code (a reviewer sharing the implementer's context reproduces its blind spots). Give it the diff, approved spec text, the artifact dir, the worktree path, and the stage ids in scope (all of them, at gate 3) — never the issue number, same as every agent in this workflow. It reads its own rules (`.claude/AGENTS.core.md`) itself. Reports on three axes — spec fidelity, standards, TDD honesty; full criteria: `spec-reviewer.md`'s `## Three axes, reported separately`.

Re-run the verification yourself, report findings + fixes. User-decision findings are raised, not silently fixed.

**Board:** reviewer appends to `artifacts/<slug>/review.md`, keyed to stage id so the right cards return to `inprogress/`. Parent card → `inreview/` when review starts.

### Gate 4 — pull request. Stop for approval.

- Verification run + reported, then **ask whether to open a PR** — user may want a manual run first; don't pre-empt it.
- Draft title + body, get approval of that text, push. Then `gh pr create`.
- CI fails on the pushed branch → `sh .claude/scripts/failed-workflow.sh <branch>`, never raw `gh run view`, to see the failure.
- Title plain language, issue's style. Body = the implementation: why, requirement IDs, how the issue was resolved (approach/structure the issue omitted), verification actually performed, the coverage number, `Closes #<issue>`.

### Merge

Squash merge to `main` — stage commits, including the ahead-of-code spec commit, never reach `main`. Then:

```sh
git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/<slug>
git worktree list   # nothing under .claude/worktrees/ should remain
```

Per-wave worktrees are already removed at wave end; this sweep catches stragglers from a stopped agent. Parent card → `done/` — no card for this run stays outside `done/`.

Merged and worktrees clean → **delete every card for this run** (stage cards, wave-gate cards, parent card): `done/` was only ever a resting spot, never the archive. Then ask the user for final "work done" approval — a distinct question from gate 4's PR approval. Approved → also delete `artifacts/<slug>/` (`spec-diff.md`, `plan.md`, `review.md`) for a clean slate. Declined → leave cards and artifacts in place; whatever prompted the decline gets sorted out before either is removed.

### Resume an interrupted run

Cards outside `open/`+`done/`, no agent running = session died mid-run. Resume triggered by the user or `/spec-feature`, never automatic.

No worktree recorded on the card → died during gate 1 dialog or gate 2 planning, nothing on disk to reconcile — resume the conversation from `spec-diff.md`/`plan.md`'s last state. Past gate 2 → table below either way. **Any resumed implementation spawns a fresh agent** — the sequential continuation only lives inside a live orchestrator session, doesn't survive a crash. This is why plan refs must be lossless: a fresh implementer resuming mid-plan gets nothing but what the plan wrote down.

**Reconcile before acting.** Card = intent, git = fact:

| Card claims | Check | Disagreement means |
|---|---|---|
| worktree | `git worktree list` | card stale |
| branch | `git rev-parse` | stage never started |
| `commit=<sha>` | sha exists, on that branch | commit never landed |
| `gauntlet=pass` | re-run at that sha | card overstated state |
| stage `done` | `git branch --contains` vs feature branch | never merged; downstream plans a lie |

Report differences first. Agree → resume. Disagree → stop and report: card behind git is a forgotten move, correctable; card claiming what git can't show is never trusted into being true.

Clean reconcile → resume only no-approval work (respawn implementers for approved stages, merge finished branches, run wave gates); halt at the first gate needing the user. Recorded `gate1`/`gate2` approvals stay valid, no re-ask.

<!-- CORE:BEGIN conventions -->
## Conventions

- Unit tests: `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at bottom of file under test, functions named `ut_*`.
- Integration tests: `tests/`, functions named `it_*`.
- Bind port 0, read the assigned port back — never a fixed port. To test bind failure, bind the occupier ephemerally first, point the server at that port.
- No real serial hardware — RTU behavior runs over an in-memory or virtual duplex pair. A test needing `/dev/tty*` is ignored or feature-gated and never runs in CI.
- Don't split a file for size alone. Split for distinct responsibilities, navigability, or coupling. Cohesive files and flat generated data stay whole.
- Start each stage by listing needed functionality and searching crates.io. Report downloads, last release, maintenance state, recommend — don't default to hand-rolling. Adding a dependency is a scope boundary: the finding goes to the user, not the manifest.
- Errors typed, never stringly. New failure mode = new error variant = public API = spec (gate 1).
- Domain values typed: unit id, data address, quantity, register value, and transaction id are distinct transparent newtypes wrapped at API entry; mixing them must not compile. Raw integers only for genuinely opaque bytes. New domain type = public API = spec (gate 1).
- No panics on wire input. Malformed, truncated, or hostile peer bytes produce a typed error — never a panic, a slice-index panic, or an unbounded allocation. Test every decode path with truncated input.
- Edition 2024, stable toolchain (`rust-toolchain.toml`); MSRV bump is normative (non-functional requirement).
- No bare `unwrap` outside tests; `expect("why this cannot fail")`.
- Specs and AI-facing files (skills, agents, `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` itself) stay concise and compact: facts only, no prose, no filler, zero information loss. Every word an agent must re-read on every load; padding is recurring cost, not one-time.
- Never read a whole file when only part is needed, filter shell output before it lands in context — not after: `sh .claude/scripts/extract-section.sh` (see `list-sections.sh` first if the heading's unknown) or `sed -n '<start>,<end>p'` instead of `cat`/Read on a whole file; narrow `find`/`git show`/`git diff` at the shell instead of dumping the full output. Applies equally to the Read tool and a Bash `cat` — both cost the same context. **Enforced, not just advisory:** a `PreToolUse` hook (`.claude/scripts/hook-guard-shell.sh`) denies an unpiped `cat` of a markdown or large file, an unscoped `git show`/`git diff`, an unscoped `find -type f/d`, a raw `gh issue view`, and a raw `gh pr view`. A denial here means take the message's redirect, not retry the same command differently.
- Read an existing PR's body/comments with `sh .claude/scripts/pr-view.sh <number>`, never raw `gh pr view` — sidesteps a GitHub Projects-Classic GraphQL bug (`repository.pullRequest.projectCards`) that errors on the raw command, with or without `--comments`.
- **Every agent's output stays concise and compact** — chat responses, stage/final reports, commit messages, PR and issue bodies, review findings: say the same thing in fewer words whenever fewer words say it. No restating what a diff, file, or prior message already shows. Extra words for the same fact are a defect, not thoroughness — applies to every agent in this workflow, not just the files they write.
- **No hard line wrap on anything posted externally** — issue bodies, PR bodies, PR/review comments. The host (GitHub) soft-wraps for display; a manually inserted `\n` mid-sentence survives rendering as a real line break and fragments the text. Paragraphs as single unbroken lines; only headings, list items, and code blocks get their own line.

## Scope boundaries — ask before

- Supporting a function code not in `docs/specs/frame/api-contract.md`. The supported set is a deliberate contract.
- Adding a dependency.
- Changing the public API surface (renaming a type, altering a signature, adding a trait bound) — semver consequences are the user's call.
- Adding a second async runtime, or a sync/blocking API.
